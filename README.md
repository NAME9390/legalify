# Legalify - Prompt Sanitizer for "Red Team" & OSINT Workflows

**Legalify** is a tongue-in-cheek terminal tool that instantly rewrites sensitive or "edgy" keywords into verbose, corporate-safe, research-oriented phrasing.  
Perfect for:

- "Red-team report drafting"  
- OSINT methodology write-ups  
- Bug bounty scope descriptions  
- "Academic security papers"  
- Turning raw notes into something you can actually paste into Notion without HR calling you

**100% offline, zero telemetry, no external dependencies.**

### Why this exists
When you're knee-deep in "penetration testing", malware analysis, or darknet OSINT, your raw notes look like a FBI watchlist.  
Legalify lets you keep the technical accuracy while making everything sound like it was written by a compliance officer on three espressos.
